Allocate instructors and plan the schedule

With the other instructors, decide:

* what content to cover (see also
  #{issue[initial-preparation/02-select-curriculum.md].number}),
* what the schedule will be, and
* who will teach what.

This usually takes a few iterations, so don't leave it until the last
minute.

Be sure to allow enough time to set up on the first day, and for
learners to fill in the post-workshop assessment on the last day.
