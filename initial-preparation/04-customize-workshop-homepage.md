Customize your workshop's homepage

Edit `index.html` in your per-workshop repository (see
#{issue[initial-preparation/01-send--url-to-swc-admins.md].number}),
customizing:

* the YAML front-matter at the top of the file,
* the schedule (see
  #{issue[initial-preparation/03-allocate-instructors.md].number}), and
* the setup instructions.

The setup instructions may depend on which lessons are being taught,
so ask your instructors what they need learners to install for their
particular lesson.
